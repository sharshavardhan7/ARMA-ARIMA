In this project, I used Walmart’s historical weekly sales data to perform end-to-end time series forecasting. 
After cleaning and exploring the data, I tested stationarity and applied differencing. 
I built ARMA and ARIMA models and evaluated them using MAE and RMSE. 
The ARIMA model outperformed ARMA by effectively capturing trends and seasonality.
The forecasts can directly support Walmart’s staffing, inventory planning, and supply-chain optimization decisions.




**Business Problem:**

Walmart operates thousands of stores globally. Poor demand forecasting can lead to:
Overstaffing / understaffing at checkout
Stock-outs or excess inventory
Inefficient supply chain & transportation costs

**Objective:**

Using historical sales data, we aim to:
Analyze weekly sales trends
Check seasonality & stationarity
Build ARMA and ARIMA models
Forecast future sales
Evaluate model performance using metrics
Translate results into business decisions

**Dataset Overview:**

Dataset: Walmart Sales Dataset (45 Stores)

**Typical columns:**

Store
